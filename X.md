## X
### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation [flat](../dep/flat) is typically used in the syntactic analysis; on the morphological layer, these words should use the feature [Foreign=Yes](../feat/Foreign.html)).

Even if foreign words are tagged `X`, this usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech.

#### Examples

* _"I toj merák <b>etmíš</b>, víka..."_ "And he says out of curiosity..."
* _"Mlózi stári i samí insán čákot ad žǽhne rábatøt faf "<b>voítia</b> <b>sto</b> <b>spíti</b>" da mí stóret..."_ 
"Many elderly and lonely people are waiting those who work at the 'Help at Home' (program)to do for them..."
* _"<b>Berekǽt</b> <b>versín</b>, razý sme."_ "Thank you, we agree."
