## ADV

### Definition

In Pomak there are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB.html) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify 
[adjectives](ADJ.html) and other adverbs, as in *<b>játse húbbe</b>* (very well) or *<b>fazlá bóržo</b>* (more quickly).

There is a closed subclass of *pronominal adverbs* that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly;
 similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the 
 [ADV](ADV.html) part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

#### Examples

* Demonstrative adverbs:
    -*itúzi* "here - the speaker - proximal", *itúka* "there - the listener - medial", *itám / inám* "over there - far away - distal"
    - *isǽ / isǽna / isægána* "now", *itagáne* "then - in the past", *inagáne* "then - in the future"
    -*isýj* "like this - the speaker - proximal", *itýj* "like this - listener - medial", *inýj* "like that - a third party - distal"
* Interrogative adverbs:
    - *kugá* "when"
    - *kadé* "where"

    * Indefinite adverbs:
        - *nǽ kugá* "sometime - no matter when"
        - *nǽ kadé* "somewhere - no matter where"

        - *nó kugá* "sometime - unknown when"
        - *nó kadé* "somewhere - unknown where" 
        - *nó kak* "somehow - unknown how" 
        - *nó kólko* "several - unknown how much" 
    * Negative adverbs:   
        - *ní kugá* "never"

    - Total:
        - *dájma, vse, óla, vrit, le* "always / all the time / continuously"

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages but they are treated as adverbs in the universal tagging scheme. In particular, *adverbial ordinal numerals* are tagged as [ADV](ADV.html).

- *pórvo / birinǧí* "first / initially / in the beginning / in the first phase"
- *ikinǧí* "secondly / in the second phase"

Several numeral adverbs are registered as [ADV]()

#### Examples

About the diminutives of the following adverbs (*húbbefce [húbbe]* "so and so", *duléčko [duléče]* "a little far") see the category [qpm-DegreeMod](../feat/qpm-DegreeMod.html).

The comparative and superlative degree of adverbs is formed with the adverbs  _po_ and _naj_ respectively: they both are distinct words.   Τhe feature [Degree](feat/Degree.html) is used to denote the positive, comparative and superlative degre of adverbs and is assigned one of the values  `Pos`, `Cmp` και `Sup` respectively. Only the comparative and the superlative degree have been declared so far while the positive degree is treated as the default.
